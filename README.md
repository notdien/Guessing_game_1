# Guessing_game_1

My first small python project, this was my first touch into the world of programming!

# Purpose

This a numbers guessing game, and basically allows the users to select from 3 difficulties, with each difficulty having different 'hearts' or 'life'. Once the users
gets the correct number, it will break out of the program and inform the user they won or if they don't get the correct number, they lose!
